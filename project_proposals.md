# Cary Goltermann Preliminary Project Proposals

### Fitbit
 * _Source_: If it's going to be anyone it'll be someone that Eugene puts me in contact with at Fitbit.
 * _Plan_: Depending on the type of data I most likely wont get, I could look at the type of workouts/frequency/dieting practices that correspond with the greatest increase in strength/speed/endurance.

### Strava
 * _Source_: Either through Zein or Adam's contacts, or through their API. I'm pretty sure at this point, after some cursory looking at the returns from the API, that the data from one of the former two sources would be more robust.
  * _Plan_: I think that the data from any of the sources would allow for a project similar to the one described in the Fitbit section. Just that it would be more specific to the domain of paced based workouts.

### NFL
 * _Source_: Burntsushi nfl stats database combined with a rotoworld news scraper.
 * _Plan_: This is my backup, I'm 98% sure that I have all the data already/have the direct means to obtain it to see if the news blurbs about a player, up to a game, have any predictive power regarding their performance in that game.
