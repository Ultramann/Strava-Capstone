##Stravaboards

A natural extension of Stravaâ€™s gameful approach to exercise tracking. A intra-segment leaderboard, with objective athlete ratings derived from all efforts on each personally attempted segment.

###Motivation

The recent gamification of difficult endeavors to serve as motivation to progress ones' skills has changed the way society looks at challenges. Strava provides a pace based exercise tracking service that allows users to compare their efforts to other users who have tried the same segment thereby instilling a gameful mindset in their user who naturally want to be at the top of the leaderboards.

However, currently, Strava does not provide it's users with a way to compare themselves across segments. To motivate why this is a difficult question to answer consider how you would objectively compare two athletes who aren't participating in the same workouts?
